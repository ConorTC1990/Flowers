The aim of this website is to faciltate the sale of flowers grown locally in an environmentally friendly matter.
I built this as an initial model in order to enable my mother to bring her side-enterprise online.

I initially envisaged a wireframe model utilising an array of buttons pinned under a Navbar.
Upon reflection and testing using smaller browser modes I found that actually a collapsing Navbar had a more pleasant UX.

With regards to UX I decided to utilise a video as my desktop background for the index.html page. 
While there are concerns about this from a UX perspective I general I stuck with it as the soft transitions, looked pleasant and would help sell the product.

                                     Backgrounds
                                     
I opted for a magenta background as it is a warm friendly colour designed to appeal to the target market. 

Photos are considered placeholders as they aren't optimal quality as yet.

Likewise I went for a consistent background image for mobile devices as they looked better in my opinion

It can be considered as functional but on go-live better pictures will be made available.

In a sprint stage it would be appropriate to go to market with it as it is functional at present.

I suppose the easy part is building something and the hard part is making it look nice!

I found the hardest part to be the responsive design stopping containers being knocked out and having an inconsistent feel throughout.

I found keeping the footer at the bottom and the Navbar pinned quite hard. It required manipulation as backgrounds were different I had hoped to copy a successful index.html and the others would follow.

I found the styling for the contact form to be quite hard and ended up replicating a free one as credited below.

                                    Design Decisions

I preferred to give each potential revenue stream its own bespoke tab.

In the early stages it is not feasible to completely achieve the scale to go online, or sell directly to shops.

It is expected thst this will happen in the near future.

                                    Lessons Learned
                                    
Firstly it is somewhat easy to envisage as to how a site will look but the actual end product may require a different approach.

For example I had a template in place but found that once it transitioned to a smaller screen it just didn't really work.

I probably could've utilised media screens earlier in the design process.

It is far easier to replicate to keep consistent but sometimes with the nature of CSS it requires a bespoke solution per specific pages.

What would I have changed about my approach? I would probably have started with the smaller screen size as I would imagine that the majority of screen readers for this specific product are probably mobile derived.

I would put a lot more annotations on my html pages especially when building as replicating it can be difficult to ascertain what I was doing.

I was having issues getting background images to work in CSS, I ended up creating different classes per page.
In future I will look at designing each better and planning my design to be consistent throughout. I created a lot of very similar classes on all 4 pages which was not my initial intention.
 
I will look at cleaning up my code more often as I found that going through the validator at the end stages of the project actually helped with soving some of my issues which in hindsight I had just been compounding.                                
                                Future enhancements
                                
 I would add an online store for click and collect.

 I'd also add a portal for repeat customers and shops/supermarkets that would like to stock the products
 
 A subscription service delivering fresh flowers weekly to homes could also be implemented.
 
 Likewise classes could be built using calendly.
 
                                 Bugs
                                 
1. On Transition the video size does not scale correctly leavig somewhat of a whitespace on the index.html page.
2. The social media links in the footer on hover the colour background transitionsto white.
3. Background picture scaling isn't quite perfect and doesn't move in line with screen as size changes.
4. Ideally list on wreaths would work with the background picture, but as they're memorial wreaths I decided against utilising a carousel for the text function.
5.

1. Drop down menu sourced from :"https://codeburst.io/how-to-make-a-collapsible-menu-using-only-css-a1cd805b1390"                               
2. I utilised the footer and iconstyles from the course notes. 
3. For the indicative price list I replicated the code from the course notes also.
4. I copied the form from https://www.sanwebe.com/2014/08/css-html-forms-designs
