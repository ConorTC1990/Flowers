It required manipulation as backgrounds were different I had hoped to copy a successful index.html and the others would follow.\n\nI found the styling for the contact form to be quite hard and ended up replicating a free one as credited below.\n\n                                    Design Decisions\n\nI preferred to give each potential revenue stream its own bespoke tab.\n\nIn the early stages it is not feasible to completely achieve the scale to go online, or sell directly to shops.\n\nIt is expected thst this will happen in the near future.\n\n                                    Lessons Learned\n                                    \nFirstly it is somewhat easy to envisage as to how a site will look but the actual end product may require a different approach.\n\nFor example I had a template in place but found that once it transitioned to a smaller screen it just didn't really work.\n\nI probably could've utilised media screens earlier in the design process.\n\nIt is far easier to replicate to keep consistent but sometimes with the nature of CSS it requires a bespoke solution per specific pages.\n\nWhat would I have changed about my approach? I would probably have started with the smaller screen size as I would imagine that the majority of screen readers for this specific product are probably mobile derived.\n\nI would put a lot more annotations on my html pages especially when building as replicating it can be difficult to ascertain what I was doing.\n\nI was having issues getting background images to work in CSS, I ended up creating different classes per page.\nIn future I will look at designing each better and planning my design to be consistent throughout. I created a lot of very similar classes on all 4 pages which was not my initial intention.\n \nI will look at cleaning up my code more often as I found that going through the validator at the end stages of the project actually helped with soving some of my issues which in hindsight I had just been compounding.                                \n                                \n                         \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                Future enhancements\n                                \n                                \n                                \n I would add an online store for click and collect.\n\n I'd also add a portal for repeat customers and shops/supermarkets that would like to stock the products\n \n A subscription service delivering fresh flowers weekly to homes could also be implemented.\n \n Likewise gardening classes could be built using calendly.\n \n \n \n                             Testing\n                             \n  Testing was completed by me and the ultimate end user my mother who is considering utilising the website as part of a business.                           \n     Links for indicative pricing and the Privacy Policy are targeted using a 'target=\"_blank\"'                          \n                                 \n                                 Bugs\n                                 \n1. On Transition the video size does not scale correctly leavig somewhat of a whitespace on the index.html page.\n2. The social media links in the footer on hover the colour background transitionsto white.\n3. Background picture scaling isn't quite perfect and doesn't move in line with screen as size changes.\n4. Ideally list on wreaths would work with the background picture, but as they're memorial wreaths I decided against utilising a carousel for the text function.\n5. The contactform isn't connected as yet but will be on go live.\n6. \n                                \n                                    Credits\n\n1.

I utilised the footer and iconstyles from the course notes. \n3. For the indicative price list I replicated the code from the course notes also.\n4. I copied the form from https://www.sanwebe.com/2014/08/css-html-forms-designs\n \n\nPhotos were taken by my mother and edited by me in windows in order for text to be more visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                ","undoManager":{"mark":-2,"position":0,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":109,"column":2},"end":{"row":109,"column":3},"action":"remove","lines":[" "],"id":2},{"start":{"row":109,"column":1},"end":{"row":109,"column":2},"action":"remove","lines":["."]},{"start":{"row":109,"column":0},"end":{"row":109,"column":1},"action":"remove","lines":["6"]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":8,"column":33},"end":{"row":8,"column":34},"isBackwards":true},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":629,"mode":"ace/mode/markdown"}},"timestamp":1573686545271}
